# What's this?

A simple example demonstrating how to setup a Scala project using the [Scala Build Tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) as well as the [Logback logging library](http://logback.qos.ch/).

When running the project (by invoking `sbt run`, assuming you have SBT installed), it will create a single log line in the `/tmp/test.log` file, if it is writable.
